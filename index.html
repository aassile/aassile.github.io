            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew, and I'm a data scientist. I have a strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, and computer science, with a
                focus on data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science from Eastern University and a Bachelorâ€™s degree in
                mathematics with a minor in computer science from Ramapo College of NJ. My academic background has equipped me with the skills to tackle complex data challenges
                and derive actionable insights from large datasets.</p>

            <p>While my educational background is extensive, I found there to be a few gaps that needed to be filled. My portfolio, along with my other projects,
                showcases how I have worked to bridge these gaps through continuous learning and practical application of data science techniques.</p>

            <p>My journey in data science began with a fascination for uncovering patterns and trends within data. I have experience
                in various programming languages, including Python, R, and SQL, and I am proficient in using data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
                I have also worked with data visualization tools like Tableau and Matplotlib to create compelling visual narratives that communicate
                insights effectively. My passion for data extends beyond technical skills; I am also deeply interested in the ethical implications of data science and the
                importance of responsible data usage. I believe that data should be used to empower individuals and communities, and I strive to apply my skills in a way
                that promotes positive social impact.</p>
                
            <p>I currently work in provider network analytics within the insurance industry, where I apply data-driven approaches to
                optimize healthcare systems and decision-making by analyzing provider performance, identifying business cost-saving opportunities,
                and improving patient experience through data-driven insights.</p>

            <p>Iâ€™m perpetually curious and passionate about learning new things, always seeking opportunities to push the boundaries
                of whatâ€™s possible with data. My goal is to innovate and contribute meaningful advancements to the field of data
                science through research, exploration, and creative problem-solving. This portfolio highlights my ongoing
                journeyâ€”combining technical expertise with a commitment to lifelong learning and impactful discovery.</p>

            <p>As I continue my journey in data science, I am excited to explore new challenges and opportunities that allow me to apply my skills
                and knowledge in meaningful ways. I am eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals and organizations that share my passion for data-driven solutions.
                Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>

            <p>Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations. I am always open to new opportunities and
                connections in the data science community. Let's connect and explore how we can work together to make a positive impact through data!</p>
            
            <p>Best regards, Andrew Assile</p>
